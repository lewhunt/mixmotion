## How to use

For casual users who just want to discover some new music with fullscreen visuals, hit the image above or link below to launch the Mixmotion web app on your mobile, desktop or TV device.

### [:point_right: Try out the App :point_left:](https://lewhunt.github.io/mixmotion/)

**https://lewhunt.github.io/mixmotion**

On playback, you'll enter an immersive lean-back mode, with the abilty to toggle on/off a vast selection of dynamic background visuals. Below is a quick video of the app transitioning between playback modes:

## Installation

Developers can also install Mixmotion Player as an open source component to use in React apps. Quickest install method is via the npm i command below. Alternatively, integrate it manually by grabbing the lib folder in this repo along with the associated dependencies.

```bash
npm install mixmotion-player
```

### Basic Usage

Import the player and render MixmotionPlayer in your own app with a Mixcloud URL. It will use default settings for the other non declared props.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { MixmotionPlayer } from "mixmotion-player";

function Demo() {
  const [url, setUrl] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    setUrl("https://www.mixcloud.com/discover/trance/?order=latest");
  }, []);

  return <MixmotionPlayer url={url} />;
}

export default Demo;
```

### Advanced Usage

The <a href='https://github.com/lewhunt/mixmotion/blob/main/src/DemoAdvanced.tsx'>advanced demo</a> and official <a href='https://lewhunt.github.io/mixmotion/'>web app</a> illustrate how the component can be customised further. Props are specified for custom buttons, video backgrounds and local data (saved items). A complete list of props are detailed further down this page.

```jsx
<MixmotionPlayer
  url={url}
  showsData={getSavedData}
  customButtons={customButtons}
  backdropVideoList={backdropVideoList}
  enableBackdropVideo={true}
></MixmotionPlayer>
```

## Why Another Music Player?

There are plenty of web players and widgets already available from the likes of Soundcloud and Mixcloud that you can integrate into your app.

Mixmotion offers something different; an immersive, full-screen playback experience with unique visual effects, while still providing free access to Mixcloud's vast music catalogue.

## What Sets It Apart?

- <b>Mixcloud Integration</b>: Simple yet versatile access to Mixcloud content that goes beyond their official widget. Access playlists, user sets, genres, tags and individual shows, with the ability to privately save favourites via local storage and share mixes.
- <b>Dynamic Visuals</b>: Artwork combined with canvas effects and video motion backgrounds generate a captivating blend of imagery within a rich, immersive music player.
- <b>Broad Device Support</b>: Designed for mobile, desktop and TV devices. Touch, cursor and arrow-key navigation help make the user experience smooth across platforms.
- <b>Future Considerations</b>: Integration with local file paths, audio streams and other music services like Soundcloud. Real-time audio visualizations and beat detection are also being considered.

## How Does It Work?

Under the hood, the component is built on top of the official <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/" target="_blank">Mixcloud API</a> and <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/widget/" target="_blank">Mixcloud Widget</a>.

It also utilises another custom component of mine - Dynamic Backdrop - to create a blend of videos layered with css and canvas animation effects. Videos are given random 'blend modes' so they merge with the canvas background to give various colour effects.

| `showsData`           | An array of locally stored shows data that can be used instead of a URL. <br />◦ The app utilises this for local-storage saved shows.                                                                                   | null    |

## Callback Props

Callback props get fired on various player events, so you can take further actions when they occur:

| Prop          | Description                                                            |

| `onReady`     | Called when media is loaded and ready to play                          |
| `onPlay`      | Called when media starts or resumes playing after pausing or buffering |
| `onPause`     | Called when media is paused                                            |
| `onBuffering` | Called when media starts buffering                                     |
| `onEnded`     | Called when media finishes playing<br />&nbsp                          |
| `onError`     | Called when an error occurs whilst attempting to play media            |

<hr>

## Custom Buttons

As illustrated in the advanced demo, the player can be overridden with custom buttons. There is a selection of pre-built action types with their own icons and behaviours or you can add your own with the "custom" action type.

```jsx
import { MixmotionPlayer, ButtonProps } from "mixmotion-player";
import { faBars } from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";

const customButtons: ButtonProps[] = [
  { action: "save", align: "right" },
  { action: "previous", align: "center" },
  { action: "playpause", align: "center" },
  { action: "next", align: "center" },
  {
    action: "custom",
    align: "right",
    label: "Queue",
    faIcon: faBars,
    onPress: () => {
      console.log("my custom button pressed");
    },
  },
];

function Demo() {
  return <MixmotionPlayer url={url} customButtons={customButtons} />;
}
```

| Button Props     | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `action`         | Choose from `custom` or one of the pre-built actions: `collapse`, `github`, `mixcloud`, `mute`, `next`, `playpause`, `previous`, `save`, `videos` |
| `align`          | Alignment of the button. Choose from `left`,`center`, `right`                                                                                     |
| `label`          | A hint text label to appear below the current button in focus. Pre-built button actions use relevent labels.                                      |
| `faIcon`         | A font-awesome icon. Pre-built button actions use relevent icons.                                                                                 |
| `onPress`        | Called when a button is pressed. Pre-built button actions have their own behaviours.                                                              |
| `onRelease`      | Called when a button is released. Currently unused.                                                                                               |
| `isSelectedFill` | Allows support of toggle behaviour (in the form of a button fill) when set to true.                                                               |
| `disable`        | Prevents button action when set to true.                                                                                                          |

## useSavedItems Hook

This custom hook is used to update and retrieve shows that are favourited/liked by the user. The below snippet from the advanced demo illustrates how to load the player with local saved data.

```jsx
import { MixmotionPlayer,
  useSavedItems,
  ShowsDataType
} from "./lib/MixmotionPlayer";

function Demo() {
  const { getSavedItems } = useSavedItems();

  const getSavedData = useMemo(() => {
    const savedItems = getSavedItems();
    if (savedItems.length)
      return {
        label: "Saved Sets",
        shows: savedItems.reverse(),
      } as ShowsDataType;
  }, [getSavedItems]);

  return (
    <MixmotionPlayer
      showsData={getSavedData}
    />
  );
}

```

<hr>

## useStore Hook

For more control you can import the `useStore` custom hook to globally access player state. View the inner components like `MixmotionPlayerUI` for examples of use. The below snippet shows basic usage to get current show title and playing state:

```jsx
// 1. import useStore
import { MixmotionPlayer, useStore } from "mixmotion-player";

// 2. get desired state values
const playing = useStore((s) => s.playing);
const title = useStore((s) => s.title);

console.log("playing: state ", playing);
console.log("Current title: ", title);

<MixmotionPlayer ... />;
```
